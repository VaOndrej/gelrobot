This project consists of two scripts

1) save_robot.py
    This script is run first and its purpose is to find the gel robot, diameter for circle where to find the hair and R, G, B values for hair

2) Then all these values need to be passed to main.py and its output is graph of angular velocity for the gel robot    
    example: python3 main.py --x 332 --y 97 --diameter 36 --red 112 --green 106 --blue 107
